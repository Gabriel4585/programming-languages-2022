# Other Courses on Programming Languages

- We borrowed most of LambdaFun from Mike Spivey's course on [Programming Langugages](https://spivey.oriel.ox.ac.uk/proglan/Programming_Languages) for Computer Science students in Oxford, in particular the way LambdaFun extends pure lambda calculus with imperative features such as assignment, memory allocation and pointers.

- [Crafting Interpreters](http://craftinginterpreters.com/contents.html). This book looks like an excellent source if you want to continue learning about interpreters. To highlight a few differences, *Crafting Interpreters* uses Java and C instead of Haskell as the target language, it implements a lexer and a parser instead of using a parser generator, and the source language is object-oriented with classes and inheritance. The first half of the book uses the JVM, the second half implements its own virtual machine including garbage collection. I only read a few bits and pieces of the book and found it full of interesting insights. Recommended, even just for browsing.

- [Programming Languages](https://opendsa-server.cs.vt.edu/ODSA/Books/PL/html/#). This course follows a similar outline. Chapters 1.1, 1.3, 2.1, 2.2, 3.1-3.4, 3.6, 3.9 could be a useful second reference for this course. The **online exercises** may also be valuable, let me know if you try them. Chapter 4 corresponds to LambdaNat and Chapter 5 to LambdaFun but the details are quite different. We only touch upon Chapter 6, so that could be further reading. Chapter 7 on Type Systems is a topic we will study in our course on Compiler Construction. 

- [Notes on Programming Paradigms](https://tgdwyer.github.io/). A course that shares many aims and methods with this one. I just browsed over the content, but it looks promising ... recommended if you want to have a different point of view on the same general topic.
