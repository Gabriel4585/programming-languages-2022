# General Feedback for Homeworks

This file contains generic feedback. It may also contain instructions for future homeworks, so please **read carefully**, whether you got full points or not.

## Week 1

Using git and latex is a requirement.

Naming conventions for files and folders are part of the assignment specification. Don't change them. Eg, it must be report.pdf, not some other name.

Put your name on the report.

Do not take over my content of Section 1. 

Be careful about typesetting. Avoid "??" for missing links/references. If you need special symbols, they are easy to google.

Use a .gitignore file to avoid committing and pushing files such as .aux, .dvi, .log, .out, .toc, .DS_Store, ...

Your repo needs to be private and I need to invited as a collaborator.	

**If you don't respect the instructions above you will loose a point on the next homework.**

If you have latex questions, try first to find the answer on stackexchange.

-1 if code or explanation was missing. Also -1 if the code was not typeset properly.

In the lecture, I emphasised that 
- the [mathematical definition](resources/gcd.jpg) of gcd can be read as a functional program in pseudo code;
- the explanation can be written by rewriting equations.
