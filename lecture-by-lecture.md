## Part 0: Functional Programming 

- [First Haskell Steps](https://hackmd.io/@alexhkurz/SJgHGZ_nw).

- L1.1: *In which I argue that, in a specific sense, functional programming is simpler (not necessarily easier) than imperative programming.* [Imperative vs functional programming](https://hackmd.io/@alexhkurz/SJKWvna6U). Homework 1 in [Greatest Common Divisor in Different Languages](https://hackmd.io/@alexhkurz/SkqMtH0sK). Don't forget to install Haskell on your laptop/desktop.


- L1.2: *In which we learn about recursion over recursively defined data types.* [Recursive programming in Haskell](https://hackmd.io/@alexhkurz/H1jUka4Gv). For a summary on what we said about Haskell watch the [videos](videos.md) entitled [The computational model of functional programming](https://youtu.be/u_OMwv8tDVg) and [Haskell Tips I](https://youtu.be/wj0j2HjMw6w).

- L2.1: *In which we look at how recursive rewriting of equation is implemented using a call stack and at how to use recursion as a powerful problem solving technique.* We started with [Rewriting and the Call Stack](https://hackmd.io/@alexhkurz/HJiulVg0U) and then looked at [Recursion as a Problem Solving Technique](https://hackmd.io/@alexhkurz/Sy7M_6yMF) and the [Towers of Hanoi](https://hackmd.io/@alexhkurz/rJQwvpyMY) (which contains HW 3 for the report).

    Here are some further resources that may help. I made a video on [Euclid's algorithm](https://youtu.be/ZcJMj0antos). Read Chapter V of [Goedel, Escher, Bach](https://www.physixfan.com/wp-content/files/GEBen.pdf) and make sure to start with the dialogue "Little Harmonic Labyrinth" (it is not a coincidence that this dialogue has a similar structure to the one described in my note on "Rewriting and the Call Stack").
