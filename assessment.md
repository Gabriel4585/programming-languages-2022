## Assessment

Assessment will be divided into a total of 200 points.

- 3 programming [assignments](assignments.md) each worth 30 points (90 points total)

- Participation worth 10 points.

- A report worth 100 points.

**Participation** in lectures and office hours as well as asking, discussing, and answering questions on the [discussion forum](discussion-forum.md). One good way to get participation going is to **ask at least one question per lecture**. Here are some reasons why I think that this is a good idea:

  - Asking good questions is one of the most important skills. It is good to use every opportunity to practice.
  - Thinking about questions is the best way to start revising the material.
  - Every question you ask is feedback that helps me to make the course more relevant to you.

**Homework:** Most lectures will finish with some homework. Some homework is graded as part of the report, but whether it is graded or not, homework is essential to achieve the learning outcomes. Come to my office hourse to discuss any questions.
